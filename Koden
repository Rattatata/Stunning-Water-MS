Description of the code:
This code is meant for the Plant monitoring system.
The LED lights will function as a feedback from the system
and are supposed to be green, yellow and red. Just like a traffic light.
The LED-lights are connected in this manner:
Red = Pin ? (not decided)
Yellow = Pin ? 
Green = Pin ?
